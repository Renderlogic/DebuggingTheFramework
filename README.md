# Debugging The Framework :: Renderlogic, Inc. Debugging Repository

## Introduction
"Debugging The Framework" was a term a developer and myself used to coin what we called the process of actually
diving into time-tested and proven frameworks looking for bugs because there was no way possible we could ever
write bad code... even though we do and its usually some new feature we just rolled out causing the issue. So
when we deployed a new issue and the project management team would be like whats going on? Why is this taking
forever... we'd say Sorry We're Debugging The Framework stupid .NET or Boost or Jquery is broken. The Project
maanger would be like oh oh well... hurry up and fix it. Que snickering from the whole dev office... you hear
that so and so... so and so's debugging the frameworks again.
